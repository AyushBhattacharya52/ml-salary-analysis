# Software Engineer Salaries: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores and visualizes a dataset of software engineer salaries using Python. It serves as a hands-on EDA project for practicing data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, and basic salary feature engineering.

Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns, trends, and distributions within a dataset of software engineering job listings. The analysis includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw salary strings
- Extracting numerical ranges (min, max, and average salary)
- Visualizing company frequency, salary distribution, and location-based trends
- Investigating salary correlation and time trends (if applicable)


Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` – data wrangling
- `numpy` – numerical operations
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – visualizations
- `re` – text processing
- `scikit-learn` – scaling (if applicable for modeling later)


Key Visualizations

- Top hiring companies
- Salary distribution histogram
- Salary boxplots by location
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Salary trends over time
